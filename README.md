# Typewriter-CSSonly-animation

Cool typewriter animation using a monospace font.

remember to set the width of your chosen text to max-content (or just use flexbox/grid like I did)

### _All the work is within other branches_

> [myversion](https://GitHub.com/Santeenee/Typewriter-CSSonly-animation/tree/myversion) branch contains only the first part of this [video](https://youtu.be/w1nhwUGsG6M "Customizable typewriter animation with CSS")

Meaning that I copied part of that until [7:07](https://youtu.be/w1nhwUGsG6M?t=427) and there I understood how the ::before thing worked.
Than I tried to create the moving caret part myself. 

And I succeeded.  Kind of.

> The [kevinP](https://GitHub.com/Santeenee/Typewriter-CSSonly-animation/tree/kevinP) branch is just a copy of the code in the same [video](https://youtu.be/w1nhwUGsG6M "Customizable typewriter animation with CSS") with little or no changes.  
> I just wanted to follow along and learn.
